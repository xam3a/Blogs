<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>I started my programming career a short time ago, and I started by learning The Odin Project, through which I learned how to create a small website using HTML.</p>

<ul>First, what is HTML?</ul>
<li>HTML is a language for describing web pages.</li>
<li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</li>
<li>HTML is not a programming language, it's a markup language.</li>
<li>A markup language is a set of markup tags.</li>
<li>HTML uses markup tags to describe web pages.</li>

<ul>Second, how do I use HTML?</ul>
<li>Controls the layout of the content.</li>
<li>Provides structure for the web page design.</li>
<li>The fundamental building block any web page.</li>

<h3>Now having mentioned the definition and working of HTML, what is the most effective application to use or implement what you have learned from HTML?</h3>

<p>When I started learning to program, many advised me to use Visual Studio Code, and I felt that it was the easiest to use, as it has many shortcuts that may help you work more easily and quickly, and you can download many programming languages on it and integrate them together for example (HTLM, CSS, JavaScript), and there is also a theme feature in which you may find a shape that suits your vision, you can also download help in arranging your work.</p>

  <ul>Now What this CSS??</ul>
<li>CSS stands for Cascanding Style Sheets.</li>
<li>Style define <b>how to display</b> HTML elements.</li>
<li>Style were added to HTML 4.0 <b>to solve a problem.</b></li>
<li><b>External Style Sheets</b> can save a lot of work</li>
<li>External Style are stored in <b>CSS files.</b></li>
<br>
<ul>How to use CSS??</ul>
<li>Apply Style to the web page design.</li>
<li>Targets various screen sizes to make web pages responsive.</li>
<li>Primarily handles the "look and feel" of a web page.</li>
